# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue (e.g., leaked credentials/tokens, unsafe permissions, or data exposure), please do NOT open a public issue.
Instead, contact the repository owner privately via GitHub profile contact methods.

## Secrets
Do not commit secrets (tokens, API keys, Script IDs, private sheet URLs) into this repository.
Use Apps Script Properties / user-specific configuration instead.
