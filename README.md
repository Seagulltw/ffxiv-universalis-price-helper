# FFXIV Universalis Price Helper (Google Sheets + Apps Script)

A Google Sheets template + container-bound Apps Script that:
- Updates unit prices using Universalis market listings (HQ/NQ logic).
- Writes a time-series trend dataset (history) into a backend sheet for charting.
- Supports checkbox HQ toggles with single-cell refresh to reduce API calls.
